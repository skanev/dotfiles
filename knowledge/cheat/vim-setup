# Rubocop

Mason installs a Rubocop that doesn't play very well with projects that have
bundler in them or with rbenv. It runs the following executable:

    ~/.local/share/nvim/mason/bin/rubocop --lsp

If you open that, it will see that it's going to be a shim that provides
rubocop independently. To make it work in all projects (especially those that
have custom rubocop stuff in them), you need to:

1. Comment out the `GEM_PATH=` line in `mason/bin/rubocop` as it confuses
   bundler.

2. Go to in `.local/share/nvim/mason/packages/rubocop/bin/rubocop`, which is
   another shim called from the previous, and fix the shebang to use the proper
   version of Ruby (`#!/usr/bin/env ruby` should do it).
