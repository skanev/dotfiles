# Paths

/etc/zprofile aggresively sets up path names unconditionally with
/usr/libexec/path_helper -s. If it is executed after ~/.zshenv and ~/.zshenv is
the one that establishes ~/.rbenv and friends, you get the default ruby,
instead of the rbenv one for login shells in iTerm. This is annoying and should
probably be automated some other way, but here's how I'm fixing it:

    # /etc/zprofile

    # System-wide profile for interactive zsh(1) login shells.

    # Setup user specific overrides for this in ~/.zprofile. See zshbuiltins(1)
    # and zshoptions(1) for more details.

    if [[ -x /usr/libexec/path_helper && ! -v DOTFILES_PATHS_LOADED ]]; then
    	eval `/usr/libexec/path_helper -s`
    fi
