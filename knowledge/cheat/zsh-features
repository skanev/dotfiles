# Random ZSH Features

Basic documentation on some interesting ZSH features.

## Named directories

ZSH allows for creating named directories. They are accessible as `~foo`, where
foo is the name of the directory. There are a couple of approaches.

Static named directories can be created with hash:

    hash -d foo=~/code/foo

Dynamic named directories can be calculated by defining a fairly untrivial ZSH
function. Check "FILENAME EXPANSIONS" under zshexp.

Having CDABLE_VARS set allows you to just CD to the directory.

    cd foo         # same as cd ~foo

## Short Loops

With `SHORT_LOOPS` set (as is by default), you can avoid the `do`/`done` in `for`, `repeat`,
`select`, `if` and `function`:

    for n in {1..10}; echo $n

## Prompt variables

You can use `psvar` to set an array of values that can be expanded with `%v`.
You can set them in a `precmd` hook to both (1) avoid extra computation and (2)
keep the prompt string tidier.

    precmd() { psvar=(`pwd` `read_thermometer`) }
    PS1='(%2v degrees), in %1v: '

## Completion

There is a lot to be said about completion, but here are a few small things:

* `C-x ?` runs completion in debug and dumps it to a file, that's inserted in
  the history. This is a new mechanism for doing interesting stuff actually.

* Another way to debug it is to open a separate terminal, run `tty` to see the
  file for it and then just print to it. It gives something like
  `/dev/ttys001` on Mac.

* The builtin `compset` can be used to specify prefixes and suffixes that
  should be ignored or autoinserted when doing completion.
