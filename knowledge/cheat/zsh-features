# Random ZSH Features

Basic documentation on some interesting ZSH features.

## Named directories

ZSH allows for creating named directories. They are accessible as `~foo`, where foo is the name of
the directory. There are a couple of approaches.

Static named directories can be created with hash:

    hash -d foo=~/code/foo

Dynamic named directories can be calculated by defining a fairly untrivial ZSH function. Check
"FILENAME EXPANSIONS" under zshexp.

Having CDABLE_VARS set allows you to just CD to the directory.

    cd foo         # same as cd ~foo

## Short Loops

With `SHORT_LOOPS` set (as is by default), you can avoid the `do`/`done` in `for`, `repeat`,
`select`, `if` and `function`:

    for n in {1..10}; echo $n

## Prompt variables

You can use `psvar` to set an array of values that can be expanded with `%v`. You can set them in a
`precmd` hook to both (1) avoid extra computation and (2) keep the prompt string tidier.

    precmd() { psvar=(`pwd` `read_thermometer`) }
    PS1='(%2v degrees), in %1v: '
